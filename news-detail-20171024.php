					<strong>Celebrating Hoan My’s Achievements</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
				 The event was attended by over 1,000 people, including dignitaries from the Ministry of Health, and the People’s Committee of Ho Chi Minh City. During the event, Hoan My was officially presented with the prestigious Labour Medal which is awarded by the President of Vietnam to an organisation that has recorded outstanding achievements in labour, creativity and national development. The event was a time for Clermont and Hoan My managers to show our gratitude to the staff for their hard work and dedication and also celebrate Hoan My’s other recent awards from Frost & Sullivan “Vietnam Hospital of the Year 2017” and Hospital Management Asia.
