                    <p>The story of Hoan My began in a humble, run-down street in Ho Chi Minh City, 23 years ago. A compassionate and highly experienced doctor, Dr Nguyen Huu Tung, took a long hard look at the overcrowded, bureaucratic and inefficient hospitals he had spent much of his career in. He decided that Vietnam needed a different kind of hospital – one that provided affordable healthcare to everyone; with the patient at the centre of every decision.</p>

                    <p>Let’s go back a little further. Dr Tung had grown up during the Vietnam war, with many friends killed in the conflict. It was this that inspired him to study medicine. Qualifying as a doctor, Dr Tung always sought innovative ways of treating his patients (something that remains a hallmark of Hoan My to this day). One season saw an unusually high number of lung conditions in children, and the facility Dr Tung worked in didn’t have any device to safely extract fluid from the lungs. Undeterred, Dr Tung invented one. Many patients would also travel to Dr Tung’s home after surgery hours. Word spread of the doctor who would “serve them as people, not just patients”.</p>

                    <p>Dr Tung found the hospital systems in Vietnam in the 1980s and 1990s riddled with problems, with staff very demotivated, and patients often discharged too early in order to make space, which led to preventable complications or even deaths. It became clear that to really make an impact, he needed to demonstrate that there was a different way. In the summer of 1997, he placed an advert in a local newspaper seeking to recruit staff for his own clinic. He was met with positive responses from a handful of passionate doctors and nurses who felt the same.</p>

                    <p>The small group of doctors found a neglected old workshop that they saw had the potential – with a lot of hard work – to become their new clinic. They rolled up their sleeves and set about renovating it. After a week of diligent painting and preparation, and sourcing the equipment they needed, the first Hoan My clinic was born.</p>

                    <p>More than two decades have passed since that historic moment, and the Hoan My network has come a long way. In December 1999, we opened Vietnam’s first private hospital on Tran Quoc Thao Road in Ho Chi Minh City. Since then, we have grown into a network of 14 hospitals and 7 clinics.</p>

					<p>With our culture firmly rooted in Dr Tung’s dream, at the crux of our clinical practice and culture is, and always will be, care with heart. As the Hoan My family continues to grow, and new hospitals, clinics, and Centres of Excellence are added to the Group, we take the utmost care to maintain first-rate quality and patient-centric clinical excellence across the wide network.</p>

					<p class="paragraph-strong">We hope that you feel that you are in excellent hands here at Hoan My. We are proud that many of the best and brightest medical practitioners in Vietnam now seek to work at our facilities. Our family of doctors and nurses aims to make your time in our facilities as comfortable and welcoming as possible. <strong class="text-blue-sky">Maintaining good health is a journey; let’s take it together</strong>.</p>
