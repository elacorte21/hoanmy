						On May 13th, the first Family Doctor clinic of Hoan My Medical Corporation was inaugurated. The new member facility will focus on taking care of the medical need of the residential community at Lexington Residence, District 2, HCMC. The Family Doctor clinic will not only reduce the work load of other healthcare facilities but also improve the quality of life in the urban area of HCMC.

					<strong>The First Family Doctor Clinic</strong>
					</p>

					<p>
					   Hoan My Family Doctor Clinic is committed to the mission of providing high quality health care services at reasonable costs for the community. Itâ€™s introduction to the Hoan My group is based on the model development plan for the family doctor clinic (FDC) in the period of 2016-2020, issued by the Ministry of Health with the aim to reduce the burden on the central health facilities and strengthen the healthcare system of the entire population. By the end of 2016, this model had been implemented by Hoan My, guided by the advice of leading experts in family medicine in Vietnam as well as emulating the model of FDC in advanced countries (like Belgium).

					<p>
						In addition to medical examinations and treatment, the Hoan My FDC model  also focuses on the management of family health by compiling records from the registered list of households in the area and neighbouring areas. It helps to keep track of the healthcare history of individuals in the family, from the young to the old, aiming to carry out screening and primary healthcare as well as participate in healthcare education. The model is designed to detect early changes in health, and to then refer patients to the right specialist. Many studies have poinpointed the early detection of disease as a means of greatly reducing the cost of treatment, as well as increasing effectiveness.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Dr. Pham Le An - Head of Training Center for Pediatric Drugs, HCMC University of Medicine and Pharmacy - commented on this model when it appeared for the first time in Vietnam: "FDC provides doctors for all. They are not the doctors of the rich, but rather serve all patients from across the community, who wish to have a thorough examination. In addition of treating family members in a holistic, consistent way from birth through the entire life journey, the family doctor is responsible for providing information about the history of the patient to the physicians or specialists so that they can grasp the course of a disease and provide a better diagnosis."

					<p>
						This is a significant first step, marking the presence of family healthcare services in the form of diverse, practical healthcare facilities under the Hoan My Medical Corporation, and also deploying doctors to residential apartments. In the near future, Hoan My is planning to replicate the FDC model in HCMC and other provinces and cities, with the purpose of serving and providing comprehensive healthcare for the community in the most convenient and effective away.
					</p>
					<p>
						With the motto "Follow your family's health", it is hoped that the FDC model will be a trusted companion for every family, to protect and improve the health of each and every family member and community.
