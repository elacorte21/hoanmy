                        The JCI standards comprised over twelve hundred measurable elements (1,200+); two hundred and ninety-one (291) standards distributed in fourteen chapters (14) of which eight (08) chapters are focused on patient-centred standards, and six (06) chapters on healthcare organisation management standards.

                        Our JCI journey at Hanh Phuc Hospital was officially launched in February 2017: the hospital team including the Board of Directors, managers, doctors, nurses, clinical and non-clinical staff and contractors went through a vigorous preparation process with more than 400+ discussions sessions, 200+ training programs, 45+ quality improvement projects on patient safety and risk management (including 50+ practice drills on fire safety), emergency codes and emergency preparedness. The whole team monitored the JCI 1200+ MEs in their daily practice, documented records, and strictly followed policies and protocol. An online incident reporting system, HM-115, was introduced to enhance reporting of adverse events and incidents, as a measure to promote a ‘Zero Harm’ culture throughout the hospital.
